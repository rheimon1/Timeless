# "Timeless" Project Starter Kit

Glad you decided to download the "Timeless" starter kit. Timeless is a social network that allows users to post only once per year.

This starter kit is not meant to be a kit to start a ready-made business. It's not meant to be production-ready code. It's meant to give you **a starting point** for the user experience, HTML, and styles so that, if you want to just focus on writing code to make it work, you can. Feel free to use as much or as little of the starter kit as you one.

## What's in the kit?
The contents of the kit cover two areas: **user experience** (how users will use the finished app) and **user interface** (the part of the app the user interacts with).

### User Experience
The first thing to decide when tackling a new project is what it will do for users and how. You'll get some resources that take care of this part for you.
* A PDF containing a series of **annotated wireframes** showing what the UI of key views might look like and describing how it might work. (`annotated-wireframes.pdf`)
* The same wireframes from the PDF but unannotated and as PNG images. (`wireframe_details.png`, `wireframe_feed.png`, `wireframe_following.png`, `wireframe_messages.png`, and `wireframe_profile.png`)
* **Two high-fidelity mockups** showing what the feed and post detail views might look like, in full color. (`hifi-feed.png` and `hifi-details.png`)

You'll find these resources in the `ux` directory.

### User Interface
You'll get a start with the app's user interface right in the starter kit.

* Markup for a view based on the high-fidelity mockup of the post detail view. (`index.html`)
* CSS for styling inspired by the high-fidelity mockup of the post detail view. (`css/styles.css`)
* A blank Javascript file already loaded by `index.html`. Feel free to just open this up and start writing your code, but you can certainly delete it and figure out your own project structure, build system, and architecture. (`js/scripts.js`)
* A logo for the project. (`img/logo.svg`)
* A placeholder photo. (`img/photo.jpg`)

You'll find these resources in the `ui` directory.
